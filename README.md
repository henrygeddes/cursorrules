## CURSOR RULES FOR ME BUT ALSO FOR THEE

_This is my personal collection of generic (Cursor Rules)[https://docs.cursor.com/context/rules] that I've used for various projects_

- All rules are generic and do NOT mention project-specific instructions.
- Rules are opinionated in favour of particular technologies; change the stack information as required
- You will likely need to change the **Metadata** included in the newer rules (`.cursor/rules`) - specifically `globs` - to match your preferred Rule Type
